Title:
<Explainable AI>

Abstract:
<Nowadays, the algorithmic decision-making system has been very common in peopleâ€™s daily lives. Gradually, some algorithms become too complex for humans to interpret, such as some black-box machine learning models and deep neural networks. In order to assess the fairness of the models and make them better tools for different parties, we need explainable AI (XAI) to uncover the reasoning behind the predictions made by those black-box models. In our project, we will be focusing on using different techniques from causal inferences and explainable AI to interpret various classification models across various domains. In particular, we are interested in three domains - healthcare, finance, and the housing market. Within each domain, we are going to train four binary classification models first, and we have four goals in general: 1) Explaining black-box models both globally and locally with various XAI methods. 2) Assessing the fairness of each learning algorithm with regard to different sensitive attributes; 3) Generating recourse for individuals - a set of minimal actions to change the prediction of those black-box models. 4) Evaluating the explanations from those XAI methods using domain knowledge.>
